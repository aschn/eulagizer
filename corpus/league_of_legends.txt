Eligibility. Only “natural persons,” as opposed to any kinds of legal entities (e.g., corporations, limited liability companies, and/or partnerships), shall have the privilege of establishing an Account. By entering into this Agreement and creating an Account, you represent that you are an adult and have the legal capacity to enter into a contract in the jurisdiction where you reside. You agree to comply with this Agreement on behalf of yourself and, at your discretion, any minor children for whom you are the parent or legal guardian and whom you have authorized to play the Game using your Account. You further agree that you are entirely liable for all activities conducted through your Account, and are responsible for ensuring that you and/or your child is aware of, understands, and complies with the terms of this Agreement and any and all other {{{PARENT_CO}}} rules, policies, notices and/or agreements. {{{NEWLINE}}} THE SITE AND THE GAME ARE NOT DIRECTED AT CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, NOR DOES RIOT GAMES KNOWINGLY COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13.

Any distribution by you of your Account and/or your Login Credentials (except as expressly provided herein or otherwise explicitly approved of by {{{PARENT_CO}}}) may result in suspension or termination of your Account. {{{NEWLINE}}} E. Suspension/Termination. {{{NEWLINE}}} By {{{PARENT_CO}}}. RIOT GAMES RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND TO YOU. Additionally, {{{PARENT_CO}}} may stop offering and/or supporting the Game at any time. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most Account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violation of this Agreement, the EULA, the Privacy Policy, or the Summoner’s Code (defined below). Accounts terminated by {{{PARENT_CO}}} shall not be reinstated under any conditions whatsoever. {{{NEWLINE}}} By You. You may terminate your Account at any time, for any reason or no reason, by contacting {{{PARENT_CO}}} at support@riotgames.com. {{{NEWLINE}}} By the Community via Crowd Sourcing. {{{PARENT_CO}}} has empowered its community of users (the “Community”) to police the compliance of other users with the “Summoner’s Code” (http://na.{{{WEBSITE}}}/articles/The_Summoners_Code), which outlines the principles of ideal game play behavior, as well as with other {{{PARENT_CO}}} policies. Consistent with the guidelines found at http://na.{{{WEBSITE}}}/legal/tribunal, Community members, including you as a user, are allowed to submit descriptions of activity and actions of certain users within the Game, and collectively determine if that particular user was in compliance with the {{{PARENT_CO}}} policies relating to user conduct, including, but not limited to, the Summoner’s Code and the Code of Conduct (defined below). This system of allowing the Community to review user behavior in the Game is called The Tribunal®. Should The Tribunal determine that you have acted in contravention of any one of the {{{PARENT_CO}}} policies, {{{PARENT_CO}}} may, in its sole and absolute discretion, ban your use of the Game and suspend, terminate and/or delete your Account. {{{NEWLINE}}} EULA or this Agreement, is expressly prohibited by law and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. {{{NEWLINE}}} Notwithstanding the above, {{{PARENT_CO}}} may make a "fan kit" available to you (which may be located on the Site) that includes a limited license to use certain {{{PARENT_CO}}} Marks and other proprietary material. Except for the license expressly granted with the "fan kit," {{{PARENT_CO}}} reserves all rights, title, and interest in {{{PARENT_CO}}} Marks and all other intellectual property, and does not authorize you to display or use such in any manner, including but not limited to use on websites, on blogs, in forums, in signatures, on products, or in printed or electronic publications. {{{NEWLINE}}} B. Game Assets, Riot Points and Virtual Items. When using the Game, you may accumulate in-Game assets associated with your Account, including, without limitation, objects, artifacts, currency, items, equipment, and/or other value or status indicators (“Game Assets”) that reside on servers operated by {{{PARENT_CO}}} as data. You acknowledge and agree that such Game Assets are accumulated as part of your Account and therefore you shall have no ownership or other property interest in any of those Game Assets. You further acknowledge and agree that {{{PARENT_CO}}} has the right, but not the obligation, to delete, alter, move, remove, or transfer any and all Game Assets, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you. {{{PARENT_CO}}} does not provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaims any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data residing on servers operated by {{{PARENT_CO}}}, including without limitation the Game Assets associated with your Account. {{{NEWLINE}}} If you have a valid, active Account, you may participate in our Riot Points service offering, which is a redeemable point system that operates like virtual currency (“Riot Points”) used to license certain Game Assets that can be used while playing the Game, including, without limitation, special champions, champion “skins,” and boosts (“Virtual Items”). Riot Points can be purchased online through the in-Game store or at retail in the form of a prepaid {{{PARENT_CO}}} Game Card. Please note that you must register your {{{PARENT_CO}}} Game Card in the in-Game store in order to access the Riot Points the card contains. Riot Points might also be provided to you by {{{PARENT_CO}}} as part of a promotion, or through other means, such as completing certain quests or achievements in the Game, or through {{{PARENT_CO}}}-sponsored contests or sweepstakes. You agree that you will be solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to the acquisition of, use of or access to Riot Points. Riot Points are sold or issued in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you purchase and where you are purchasing. As {{{PARENT_CO}}} feels necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion, {{{PARENT_CO}}} may limit the total amount of Riot Points that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total Riot Points that may be held in your Account in the aggregate. {{{PARENT_CO}}} will notify you in the event that you near any such limit. Additionally, price and availability of Riot Points and/or Virtual Items are subject to change without notice. {{{NEWLINE}}} You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Riot Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify {{{PARENT_CO}}} immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Riot Points balance. {{{PARENT_CO}}} will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. {{{PARENT_CO}}} will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that {{{PARENT_CO}}} has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy. {{{NEWLINE}}} YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE RIOT POINTS SYSTEM AND THE VIRTUAL ITEMS YOU ACQUIRE HAVE NO MONETARY VALUE AND CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR CASH. NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF RIOT POINTS OR FOR VIRTUAL ITEMS OBTAINED USING RIOT POINTS. Some Virtual Items you obtain may have expiration dates while others do not, and each Virtual Item you obtain using Riot Points will be included in your Account until the earlier of that Virtual Item’s expiration date, or your Account’s expiration or termination date, or such date when {{{PARENT_CO}}} ceases to offer or support the Game. {{{NEWLINE}}} The sale or transfer of Virtual Items or Riot Points between users may only be conducted via services approved of and provided by {{{PARENT_CO}}}, if any, and {{{PARENT_CO}}} may terminate any Account that acts in contravention of this prohibition. {{{NEWLINE}}} NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF RIOT GAMES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR RIOT POINTS THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR RIOT POINTS OR VIRTUAL ITEMS. FURTHERMORE, RIOT GAMES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE DESTRUCTION, DELETION, MODIFICATION, IMPAIRMENT, “HACKING,” OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR RIOT POINTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DELETION OF GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR RIOT POINTS UPON THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT. {{{NEWLINE}}} C. Unsolicited Idea Submissions. {{{PARENT_CO}}} values your feedback on its services and products, but please do not submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials. Neither {{{PARENT_CO}}} nor any of its employees and/or contractors accept or consider unsolicited ideas, original creative artwork or other works, including, without limitation, ideas or suggestions for new or improved games or technologies, game or product enhancements, marketing plans or names for new games (collectively “Unsolicited Ideas”). Please do not send your Unsolicited Ideas to {{{PARENT_CO}}} or its employees and/or contractors. This policy is aimed at avoiding potential misunderstandings or disputes when {{{PARENT_CO}}}’ products or services might seem similar to Unsolicited Ideas that are submitted. If you do submit your Unsolicited Ideas to {{{PARENT_CO}}} or to any of its employees and/or contractors despite this policy, then you hereby acknowledge and agree that, from the time of transmission or dispatch, you grant {{{PARENT_CO}}} and its designees a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable, transferable, assignable, non-exclusive and royalty-free right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale and import your Unsolicited Ideas, including, without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, industrial rights and all other intellectual and proprietary rights related thereto, in any media now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, including, without limitation, giving the Unsolicited Ideas to others, without any compensation to you. To the extent necessary, you agree that you undertake to execute and deliver any and all documents and perform any and all actions necessary or desirable to ensure that the rights to use the Unsolicited Ideas granted to {{{PARENT_CO}}} as specified above are valid, effective and enforceable. You also give up any claim that any use by {{{PARENT_CO}}} and/or its licensees of your Unsolicited Ideas violates any of your rights, including but not limited to moral rights, privacy rights, rights to publicity, proprietary or other rights, and/or rights to credit for the material or ideas set for therein. {{{NEWLINE}}} Summoner’s Code for additional guidance on exemplary game-play behavior.

The Properties. In an effort to improve the Properties, you agree that {{{PARENT_CO}}} may change, modify, update, suspend, “nerf,” or restrict your access to any features or parts of the Properties, and may require that you download and install updates to the Software, at any time without notice or liability to you. You also understand and agree that any such changes or updates to the Properties might change the system specifications necessary to play the Game, and in such a case, you, and not {{{PARENT_CO}}}, are responsible for purchasing any necessary additional software and/or hardware in order to access and play the Game. {{{NEWLINE}}} copyright@riotgames.com. This email address is intended solely for the receipt of said notices and not for general inquiries or requests of {{{PARENT_CO}}}. Attachments cannot be accepted at the email address for security reasons. Accordingly, any notification of infringement submitted electronically with an attachment will not be received or processed. Please note that these notifications are legal notices, and that {{{PARENT_CO}}} may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or to third parties, at its discretion or as required by law. The Privacy Policy does not protect information provided in these notices. {{{NEWLINE}}} EULA OR THEPRIVACY POLICY. {{{PARENT_CO}}} reserves the right, at its own expense and in its sole and absolute discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with {{{PARENT_CO}}} in asserting any available defenses. {{{NEWLINE}}} www.adr.org. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section XV.B and either the AAA Rules or the AAA Consumer Rules, the terms in this Section XV.B will control and prevail. {{{NEWLINE}}} Except as otherwise set forth in Section XV.F, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and {{{PARENT_CO}}} will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and {{{PARENT_CO}}} may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law. {{{NEWLINE}}} BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND RIOT GAMES ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. {{{NEWLINE}}} C. Arbitration Fees. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by the AAA Rules for initiating the arbitration. Your share of all other fees and costs of the arbitration, including your share of arbitrator compensation, will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules, and where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. Where your share of the costs is deemed to be excessive by the arbitrator, {{{PARENT_CO}}} will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. {{{NEWLINE}}} D. Location. The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify {{{PARENT_CO}}} in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of {{{PARENT_CO}}}’ arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles, California, United States of America, and you and {{{PARENT_CO}}} agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. {{{NEWLINE}}} E. Limitations. You and {{{PARENT_CO}}} agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between {{{PARENT_CO}}} and you individually. YOU AND RIOT GAMES AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER. {{{NEWLINE}}} F. Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration. You and {{{PARENT_CO}}} agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or {{{PARENT_CO}}}’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration. {{{NEWLINE}}} G. Governing Law. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the “Act”) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement. {{{NEWLINE}}} H. Severability. You and {{{PARENT_CO}}} agree that if any portion this Section XV is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section XV.F), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section XV.F is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor {{{PARENT_CO}}} will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section XV.F found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America, and you and {{{PARENT_CO}}} agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. {{{NEWLINE}}} support@riotgames.com as stated above. Upon termination of this Agreement, your right to use the Properties shall immediately cease. {{{NEWLINE}}} support@riotgames.com, or visit the “support” tab on the Site. {{{NEWLINE}}} C. Entire Agreement.

Force Majeure. {{{PARENT_CO}}} shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of {{{PARENT_CO}}}, including, without limitation, any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond {{{PARENT_CO}}}’ control such as acts of god, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials. {{{NEWLINE}}} E. Location. The Site and the Game are operated by {{{PARENT_CO}}} in the United States. Those who choose to access the Site and/or the Game from locations outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. The Software is subject to United States export controls as set forth in the EULA. {{{NEWLINE}}} F. No Partnership. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and {{{PARENT_CO}}} as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Site or the Game. {{{NEWLINE}}} G. No Waiver. {{{PARENT_CO}}}’ failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by {{{PARENT_CO}}} of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. {{{NEWLINE}}} H. Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices given by you or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to: {{{PARENT_CO}}}, Inc., 10736 Jefferson Blvd., #622, Culver City, CA 90230. {{{NEWLINE}}} I. Reform and Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, it is determined that such provision cannot be reformed, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. {{{NEWLINE}}} J. Section Headings. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement or have any other legal effect. {{{NEWLINE}}} K. Survival. The provisions of Sections IV, VI.A, IX, XI-XV, and XVII shall survive any termination of this Agreement. {{{NEWLINE}}} YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT SELECTING THE “ACCEPT” BUTTON BELOW AND/OR YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE PROPERTIES IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
